Shows a popup dialog with terms and conditions (EULA) that must be accepted before a file can be downloaded

== Description ==
Terms Before Download adds a shortcode that can be used instead of HTML anchors to link to downloadable files. If such a link is clicked a popup dialog shows terms and conditions (EULA) which must be accepted for the download to start.

The terms and conditions are read from a Wordpress page. That way there is only a single place to maintain the terms and they can easily be displayed independently of the plugin.

The plugin supports Google Analytics to keep track of the number of downloads.

An example of the plugin in action can be found here: http://helgeklein.com/download/

# Usage

Add the shortcode *tbd_terms* once (!) to each page or post where terms need to be displayed and configure the ID of the page that contains the terms. Example:

[tbd_terms terms_page_id=5670]

The page ID is part of the URL when editing a page in the admin UI. *Example: http://domain.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=5670&action=edit*

Create a link to a downloadable file like this:

[tbd_link url=\"URL\"]link text[/tbd_link]
